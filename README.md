# Eureka

I have always wanted to discover more about low-level computing, OS internals and other bare-bones stuff. In this repository I will try to follow some of the renowned "os-from-scratch" guides.

Apart from that, this repository will serve as a collection of resources that I found useful throughout the learning process.

Feel free to use for any purposes
