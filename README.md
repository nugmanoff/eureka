# Eureka

This is a personal learning project aimed to learn more about low-level computing, hardware, OS internals and other bare-bones stuff. For now, I will try to follow some of the renowned "os-from-scratch" guides.

Apart from that, this repository will serve as a collection of resources that I found useful throughout the learning process.

Feel free to use for any purposes 

For any suggestions & enquiries feel free to contact me on [Telegram](https://t.me/nugmanoff)
